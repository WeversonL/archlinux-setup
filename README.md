# Arch Linux Setup

Script created in order to install and configure some tools used by me in Arch, either on the desktop or in WSL2

It can be changed for each case and need. Be aware if any module/driver is not compatible with your hardware [I'm using NVIDIA and AMD], or if you don't want something to be installed

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code

        git clone https://github.com/WeversonL/archlinux-setup.git 

2. Run the script with sudo

        sudo ./setup.sh

⚠️ Still in development
