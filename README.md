# Script for Arch Linux

## These scripts can be changed to your preference, in order to speed up your installation.

Script created in order to install and configure some tools used by me in Arch, either on the desktop or in WSL2. 

1. Clone the repository or download the source code


```
git clone https://github.com/WeversonL/archlinux-setup.git 
cd archlinux-setup
```
2. Run the script with sudo

```
sudo ./setup.sh
```

## Check the script before running!! If a module is not compatible with your hardware [I'm use NVIDIA and AMD], or if you don't want that installation to be done.

### Still in development
